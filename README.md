#### Cookie Clicker
It speaks for itself.

I started on 22/05/2023 and got pretty into the game for a few months, as of today (19/03/2025), my last ‘serious’ time engaging with the game was 03/07/2023 and since then I haven’t touched the game which is this save file.

I might pick this up as a side project to work on, I found some promising repo’s that let you self-host cookie clicker, I wonder if I could create a self-hosted instance of cookie clicker that I can access anywhere online? Maybe deploy it on vercel with my save game so I don’t have to manually create backups?
